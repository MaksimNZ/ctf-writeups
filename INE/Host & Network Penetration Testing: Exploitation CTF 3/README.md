# Host & Network Penetration Testing: Exploitation CTF 3 (Target 1)

## Objective
Exploit vulnerabilities across the target machine, gaining initial access to the target.

## Target 1 Reconnaissance
An initial nmap scan was performed to identify any open ports and services running on the target.
```bash
nmap -sV -T4 -p- target1.ine.local
```
The scan revealed two exposed services: an FTP service running ProFTPD 1.3.5 on port 21, and an HTTP service provided by Apache HTTP Server 2.4.41 on port 80, indicating a potential web application attack surface.

Based on the services identified, ProFTPD 1.3.5 is an outdated service, potentially pointing to vulnerbilities discovered, so this was picked for further investigation.

## Enumeration
Searching for the potentially vulnerable service using searchsploit and Exploit DB, revealed a vulnerability within the service.

This confirmed that ProFTPD 1.3.5 was the most promising entry point for exploitation.

## Exploitation
The identified ProFTPD 1.3.5 service, allowed any unauthenticated client to exploit the SITE CPFR/CPTO commands in the ProFTPD version 1.3.5 to copy files from any part of the filesystem to a chosen destiniation. 

By using /proc/self/cmdline to copy a PHP payload to the website directory, PHP remote code execution is made possible.

Using the Metasploit module exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec, access was obtained to the target.

## Post Exploitation
Local enumeration was preformed after gainig access, leading to the flag discovery in the / directory.

## Lessons learned
- Early service identification helps narrow the attack surface efficiently
- Outdated services often introduce critical vulnerabilities
